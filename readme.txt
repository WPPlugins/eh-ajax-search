WordPress/WooCommerce Search makes your user's search for products/posts/formus/topics quick and useful. This could be achieved using a simple Short code.

== Description ==

Do visitors of your WordPress/WooCommerce site complain often that they are not able to find specific products, blogs or documents easily on your site? You have large volumes of products and documentation structured into different categories and hierarchies. Understandably it’s not easy for your visitors to navigate and find the exact product or document they are looking for. Worry not! Here is a WordPress plugin that would present an immediate and uncomplicated solution for this dilemma.

WordPress / WooCommerce AJAX Search will provide a simple search box for your customers to browse through the vast number of products and documentation on your store quite easily. When customers enter a search keyword or phrase, all the results relevant to that will be fetched from your website’s database and displayed instantly. As soon as the user starts typing on the search box, the plugin would provide a list of suggestions to assist with the search as well.

In cases where the user is not entirely sure about the search term, they can enter a related keyword or phrase, and the search box gives results matching to that. The quality of the search would improve depending on the information provided by the user. This way your customers and store visitors are spared of the tedious task of going through all the WooCommerce categories on your store.
